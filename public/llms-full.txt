## About Piero Perilli

Piero Perilli is a VFX artist and post-production supervisor based in Rome, Italy, with over 20 years of professional experience. His background is unique: he started as a watchmaker, developing an obsessive attention to detail that he now applies to every pixel. This isn't a marketing label — it's how he works: with the patience and precision of someone who assembles mechanical movements, applied to visual creation.

Piero's core strength is his integrated workflow. Unlike traditional post-production pipelines where projects pass between multiple specialists, Piero handles VFX, motion graphics, color grading, and editing in a single pipeline. This eliminates handoffs, reduces costs, and ensures creative coherence from start to finish.

In recent years, Piero has integrated AI tools (Runway, Veo, Kling AI) into his professional workflow — not as a replacement for traditional VFX skills, but as a force multiplier. His 20 years of visual expertise guide the AI output, ensuring professional quality that purely AI-generated content cannot match.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### VFX
**Q: How much does a VFX artist cost in Rome, Italy?**
A: Costs depend on project complexity. A single basic compositing shot starts from a few hundred euros, while complex projects with set extension, 3D tracking and green screen require a more significant investment. Free quotes provided after reviewing footage and brief.

**Q: What is the difference between VFX and CGI?**
A: VFX encompasses all post-production image manipulation (compositing, green screen, rotoscoping, tracking). CGI is a subset specifically about fully computer-generated elements like 3D models. Piero's workflow integrates both.

**Q: Do you work only in Rome or also remotely?**
A: Both on-site in Rome/Venice and remotely for clients across Italy and internationally. VFX post-production is perfectly suited for remote collaboration.

### Motion Graphics
**Q: How much does a motion graphics video cost for a brand?**
A: A 30-second social animation starts from approximately €800-1,500. A 60-90 second corporate video with custom storyboard ranges €2,000-5,000.

### 3D Animation
**Q: How much does a 3D product animation cost?**
A: Starting from €1,500-3,000 for a 15-30 second video including modeling, texturing, lighting and rendering. More complex projects can exceed €5,000.

### Post-Production
**Q: Why choose an integrated workflow instead of separate specialists?**
A: With separate specialists, each handoff adds time, costs and error risk. The integrated workflow manages everything from editing to final master in a single pipeline — more coherent, faster, and more cost-effective.

**Q: How much does professional color grading cost?**
A: Color grading for a short film (10-20 min) starts from €500-1,500. For a 30-60 second commercial, €300-800.

### AI Video
**Q: Can AI replace traditional video production?**
A: Not completely. AI accelerates certain phases and opens new possibilities, but professional expertise is needed to direct the output. Without a trained eye, AI output remains amateur. The best results come from hybrid workflows.

**Q: How much does an AI-produced video cost?**
A: Generally lower than traditional production (no sets, crew, equipment needed). A 30-60 second commercial with hybrid AI + post-production workflow starts from €1,000-3,000.
